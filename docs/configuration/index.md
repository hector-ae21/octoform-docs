# Configuration reference

Every key `octoform.yml` accepts. Read [core concepts](../concepts/index.md) first if you
have not — tri-state values and layered precedence are assumed throughout.

The file has no schema version and no required key other than `owner`.
Anything you do not write is not managed.

## Top level

### `owner`

**Required. String.** A GitHub organisation or a personal account.

```yaml
owner: your-org
```

Which of the two it is, octoform asks the API — it is never declared here. An
organisation and a user can share a login, and a configuration file is the
wrong place to be wrong about that.

What changes between the two:

| | Organisation | Personal account |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Custom properties | available | **do not exist** — types come from `repos.<name>.type` |
| Which repositories are listed | all the org's | yours only, and private ones only when the token is your own |
| Rulesets on private repositories | capability probed per repository and token | capability probed per repository and token |

### `imports`

**String array.** Other configuration files to fold in before this one.

```yaml
imports:
  - presets/security-baseline.yml
  - presets/npm-library.yml
```

- Paths are resolved **relative to the file that lists them**, and an imported
  file can import further files.
- **Most general first**: a later import beats an earlier one, and this file's
  own content beats every import.
- Circular imports are detected and reported with the full chain.
- An imported file does not need an `owner` — that is the point. A file with
  `types` and `defaults` and no `owner` is a shared preset, usable by owners
  that know nothing about each other. Two files declaring *different* owners is
  an error.

### `exclude`

```yaml
exclude:
  repos: [scratch, some-fork]
```

Dropped entirely: not audited, not planned, not applied, not counted. For a
repository you want to see but not govern, use
[`manage: false`](#manage) instead.

### `defaults`, `types` and `repos`

The three precedence layers. All three take the same [policy blocks](#policy-blocks).

```yaml
defaults:              # every repository that is not excluded
  features: { wiki: false }

types:                 # by recorded type — the name is yours, it means nothing here
  library:
    environments: [{ name: npm }]

repos:                 # one repository, by name
  the-odd-one:
    features: { wiki: null }
```

`repos.<name>` additionally accepts **`type`**, which declares the repository's
type in the file rather than reading it from the custom property. A type
declared here wins over the property — which is what makes octoform work on a
plan without custom properties, and is the only source available on a personal
account.

A `type` naming something not declared under `types` is an error, caught when
the file loads rather than halfway through a run.

### `classify`

Where a repository's type comes from, and how to infer one for repositories
that have none.

```yaml
classify:
  property: project-type
  rules:
    - when: { file_exists: package.json, json: { private: true } }
      type: application
    - when: { file_exists: package.json }
      type: library
    - when: { visibility: private }
      type: internal
```

| Key | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `property` | string | Name of the GitHub **organisation custom property** holding the type. Ignored for a personal account, which has no such API. |
| `rules` | list | Conditions used by [`octoform classify`](../commands/index.md#octoform-classify) to propose a type. Never used to *apply* one during `plan`/`apply`. |

Each rule is `{ when: {...}, type: <name> }`. Inside `when`:

| Condition | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `file_exists: <path>` | The repository has a file at that path. |
| `json: { key: value }` | Shallow match against the JSON file named by `file_exists`. Every listed key must equal the given value. |
| `visibility: public\|private` | The repository's visibility. |

**First match wins**, so order is significant and narrower rules go above
broader ones — `package.json` with `private: true` must be tested before plain
`package.json`, or the second would swallow everything. octoform has no idea
which of your rules is the narrower one; that is why the order is yours.

A rule with an empty `when: {}` matches everything, which is a legitimate way
to write a final catch-all. A file that exists but is not the JSON the rule
expected is simply not a match, not an error.

### `audit`

Read-only expectations. These never change anything; they exist so that "every
public repository needs a description" is a line of configuration instead of a
branch in somebody's code.

```yaml
audit:
  require_type: true
  require_description: { visibility: public }
  require_topics: { visibility: public }
  max_topics: 8
```

| Key | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `require_type` | boolean | Report repositories with no recorded type. **Defaults to on** — set it to `false` to disable. The only key here that is on unless you say otherwise. |
| `require_description` | `{ visibility }` | Report repositories of that visibility with no description. |
| `require_topics` | `{ visibility }` | Report repositories of that visibility with no topics. |
| `max_topics` | number | Report repositories with more topics than this. |

`require_description` and `require_topics` need their `visibility` — an empty
`{}` matches nothing at all, because an absent visibility is the tri-state
"not managed" rather than "any". Archived repositories are never reported.

## Policy blocks

Everything below can appear in `defaults`, in `types.<type>`, or in
`repos.<name>`.

### `manage`

**Boolean.** `manage: false` means: inventory it, audit it, apply nothing.

Unlike [`exclude`](#exclude), the repository still appears in `audit` output.
Use it for something you have deliberately decided not to govern but still want
to see in the report.

### `features`

| Key | GitHub field | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `issues` | `has_issues` | |
| `wiki` | `has_wiki` | |
| `projects` | `has_projects` | |
| `discussions` | — | **Never applied.** See [below](#what-is-never-applied-and-why). |

Applied in the repository `PATCH`, bundled with `merge` and `repo`.

### `merge`

| Key | GitHub field |
| --- | --- |
| `allow_squash` | `allow_squash_merge` |
| `allow_merge_commit` | `allow_merge_commit` |
| `allow_rebase` | `allow_rebase_merge` |
| `allow_auto_merge` | `allow_auto_merge` |
| `allow_update_branch` | `allow_update_branch` |
| `delete_branch_on_merge` | `delete_branch_on_merge` |

`delete_branch_on_merge` is the half of branch hygiene people forget: a
protected branch surrounded by fifty stale merged branches is still a mess.

### `security`

| Key | Endpoint | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `secret_scanning` | repository `PATCH`, under `security_and_analysis` | |
| `secret_scanning_push_protection` | idem | |
| `vulnerability_alerts` | `PUT`/`DELETE .../vulnerability-alerts` | Dependabot alerts. |
| `automated_security_fixes` | `PUT`/`DELETE .../automated-security-fixes` | Dependabot security updates (the PRs). |
| `private_vulnerability_reporting` | `PUT`/`DELETE .../private-vulnerability-reporting` | |
| `code_scanning_default_setup` | `PATCH .../code-scanning/default-setup` | CodeQL **without** a workflow file in the repository. |

Two caveats worth knowing before you declare these fleet-wide:

**`secret_scanning` and `code_scanning_default_setup` on private repositories
need a paid plan.** Where they are unavailable, GitHub does not report them as
"off" — it omits them, which octoform reports as unreadable and blocks rather
than guessing.

**`code_scanning_default_setup` is incompatible with a `codeql.yml` of your
own.** Enabling the default setup on a repository using advanced setup turns
the advanced one off. If you have per-repository CodeQL workflows, leave this
key out for those repositories rather than setting it `false`.

### `repo`

| Key | Endpoint | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `description` | repository `PATCH` | |
| `homepage` | repository `PATCH` | |
| `topics` | `PUT .../topics` | Compared as a **set**: order never counts as drift. |
| `allow_forking` | repository `PATCH` | |
| `web_commit_signoff_required` | repository `PATCH` | |

`description`, `homepage` and `topics` are inherently per-repository — they
belong in `repos.<name>`, not in a type. GitHub returns an unset description as
an empty string in some responses and `null` in others; neither counts as drift
against the other.

### `default_branch`

```yaml
default_branch:
  name: main
  rename_from: [master]
```

| Key | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | What the default branch should be called. |
| `rename_from` | string array | Only rename when the current name is one of these. |

Applied with `POST .../branches/{branch}/rename`.

This is the only change that reaches outside a repository's settings, so it is
gated twice.

**`rename_from` is a safety catch, not a filter.** A repository whose default
branch is not on the list is *reported as blocked*, not renamed — a branch
nobody anticipated is a branch nobody thought about, and renaming it anyway
would be the tool deciding something the configuration declined to decide. Omit
`rename_from` entirely to rename unconditionally.

**Workflows are named as a warning.** GitHub retargets open pull requests and
redirects the old branch name by itself. It does not rewrite a workflow that
names the branch — `on: push: branches: [master]` keeps parsing perfectly and
simply stops matching anything, with no error anywhere. So `plan` reads the
repository's workflow files first and names the ones that will break. It never
edits them; that is yours to do.

A repository with no default branch at all (an empty one) is reported as
blocked rather than failing.

### `ensure_branches`

```yaml
ensure_branches: [main]
```

**String array.** Guarantees the branch exists, created from the current
default branch's tip.

It never deletes a branch, never moves one that already exists, and never
touches contents. Creating it is the entire contract.

### `rulesets`

```yaml
rulesets:
  - name: version-branches
    target_branches: ['v*.x']
    required_approvals: 1
    required_checks: ['CI complete']
    block_force_push: true
    block_deletion: true
```

| Key | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Identifies the ruleset. Renaming it creates a second one. |
| `target_branches` | string array | What it applies to. See below. |
| `required_approvals` | number | Approving reviews needed to merge. |
| `required_checks` | string array | Status checks that must pass. |
| `block_force_push` | boolean | Refuses force-pushes (`non_fast_forward`). |
| `block_deletion` | boolean | Refuses branch deletion. |

**`target_branches`** accepts a literal name (`main`), a glob (`v*.x`), or
GitHub's own placeholders — `~DEFAULT_BRANCH`, which follows a rename, and
`~ALL`. Plain names are turned into refs (`refs/heads/main`) at the API
boundary; you write branch names, not refs.

**`required_approvals: 0` is meaningful and different from omitting it.** Zero
still creates the pull-request rule, so the branch stops accepting direct
pushes and every change has to arrive as a pull request — it just does not
require anyone to approve it. That is the right setting for a
single-maintainer repository, where GitHub will not let you approve your own
pull request and `1` would lock the only person who can merge out of merging.

**Only what you declare is compared.** A ruleset carrying rules octoform does
not model is not "different" — treating it as such would make every run offer
to strip whatever somebody configured by hand. A ruleset that exists and is
*not* declared here is left completely alone; octoform never deletes one.

`enforcement` is always `active` and `target` is always `branch`. Neither is
configurable, on purpose: a ruleset in evaluate mode reads like protection that
is not there.

**Private repositories.** GitHub only enforces rulesets there when the owner
plan and token permit it. octoform probes that capability for each private
repository that declares rulesets, without naming or interpreting GitHub
plans: it reads the default branch's protection, whose availability follows
the same plan matrix as repository rulesets. Existing protection and GitHub's
explicit `Branch not protected` response both prove the capability is
available; a forbidden or opaque not-found response does not.

The probe never creates, changes or deletes anything. If the repository is
empty and has no default branch, the capability cannot be established safely,
so the ruleset remains blocked until there is a branch to probe. This applies
identically to organisation and personal owners, including paid access granted
through GitHub Education rather than a separately reported plan name.

### `environments`

```yaml
environments:
  - name: npm
    reviewers: [some-user, another-user]
```

| Key | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | The environment name. |
| `reviewers` | string array | GitHub **logins** that must approve a deployment. |

Applied with `PUT .../environments/{name}`. Logins are resolved to numeric ids,
which is what the endpoint wants; a login that does not resolve fails the whole
change rather than quietly creating an environment with fewer reviewers than
you asked for.

A missing environment is created; an existing one has its reviewers
**corrected**, not just left alone — GitHub's list endpoint already returns
each environment's required-reviewers rule, so this costs no extra request.
Reviewers are compared as a set, same as `topics`: order is never drift.

**One case is deliberately left blocked instead of corrected.** If an
environment's required reviewer is a **team** rather than a user, octoform
reports it as blocked rather than acting on it. It only ever resolves a
declared reviewer to a *user* id — it has no way to compare against or write
a team — so reading that case as "no reviewers" would make a normal-looking
change quietly replace the team's protection with your declared users the
moment `apply` ran. If you manage an environment through a team reviewer,
octoform leaves it alone until you either switch it to user reviewers or team
reviewers are supported.

### `files`

```yaml
files:
  - path: .github/dependabot.yml
    from: files/dependabot/npm.yml
    mode: create-if-missing
```

| Key | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | string | Where it goes in the repository. |
| `from` | string | Local file to copy. Resolved **relative to the configuration file that declares it**. |
| `mode` | `create-if-missing` | The only mode. |

`from` resolving against its own file is what lets a shared preset be imported
from anywhere without its file references breaking — the same rule
[`imports`](#imports) follows.

**`create-if-missing` is the only mode, deliberately.** Seeding what is absent
is safe; overwriting whatever a repository already has at that path is the
fastest way to destroy work nobody asked this tool to touch. The write is sent
without a blob `sha`, which means GitHub *refuses* it if the file appeared
between `plan` and `apply` — failing there is the correct answer, not
overwriting.

This exists mostly for the files GitHub does **not** inherit from a `.github`
repository: `dependabot.yml`, workflows and `CODEOWNERS`. `SECURITY.md`,
`CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` do inherit, and seeding a local copy
of one would silently stop that inheritance.

## What is never applied, and why

| Policy | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `features.discussions` | GitHub has no REST field for it anywhere — `repos/update` does not accept `has_discussions` and there is no dedicated endpoint. It is GraphQL-only. Reported as blocked rather than attempted. |
| Anything on an **archived** repository | Archived repositories are read-only on GitHub's side. Reporting changes that can never be applied would be noise on every run. |
| Environment `reviewers`, when the current reviewer is a **team** | octoform only resolves a declared reviewer to a *user* id — comparing against a team would risk silently replacing it. See [`environments`](#environments). |
| Rulesets on private repositories where the owner plan and token do not expose the capability | They would exist without being enforced, or could not be written by this token. See [`rulesets`](#rulesets). |
| Any setting whose current value could not be read | Planning a change from an answer you never got is how a tool reports drift that does not exist. See [blocked is not skipped](../concepts/index.md#3-blocked-is-not-skipped). |
